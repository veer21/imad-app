    <p>Finaly,After the call Balmy Girl messesged to the Writer "plzz don't tells to anyone that we were talking in a phone call "</p>
    <P>Then,the Writer says "Okkk Dear"</P>
    <p>After that,Again texting is going ON.....</p>
    <p>The above things is so looking simple,but actually what is going on with the writer no one knows,when he is going to propose his Balmy....
he can't imagine what he is going to do..but with all courage initially he tried the most wonderful 3 magical words>>>>with I only...bcoz he is too much afraid what she thinks about him.
