     <p>The Most interested Question is,Why  the Title is"A LIP BALM GiRL"???????<br>
      !!!The Title is A LIP BALM GiRL, Because she used to LIP BALM  on her BeAUtYFuL PINK LIPS ...!!!</p>


      <p><u> the story starts since a ceremony........</u>
when the first time writer saw that girl then suddenly a feeling of attraction arises towards her, GOD knows whether it is the, feeling of crush or the feeling of love. but due to lack of communication or due to the busy schedule of the ceremony writer unable to interact with her... then after the ending of the ceremony both of them are separated from each other towards their DestiNatioN.

</p>
<p>After that AGAIN both of them are meeted in a group.but still writer unable to interact with her. after that a moment came when, may be by mistake,she texts him then suddenly a rise of hope arises in him. then till onwards a game of texting message get started and this game consists lots of emojis,certain feelings...Etc, and Finally  he puts his Feeling towards her and the writer thinks that the BalmY Girl also Liked him........</P>

    <p>.....</p>

    <p><u>The above things is so looking simple,but actually what is going on with the writer no one knows about ,when he is going to do....</u>
but with all courage initially he tried the most wonderful 3 magical words>>>>with I only...bcoz he is too much  and finally, he purposed her by saying "I like U" in place of " I love you" because the writer is really afraid of her like what she thinks about me? is she really like me? , or it just an illusion from my side, so many thoughts is coming in his mind like a Tornado.
</p>
<p>after his proposal Balmy says "Engineering waali flirting", this sentence breaks the heart of the writer...
Suddenly, after that, the Writer thinks that "We engineers are really this much inFamous" but in reality the writer really love her...</p>
<p>After this the writer says No my dear I am not that type of guy..so please don't include me in that category of Engineers...
after her statement writer is the dilemma whether "the story is over" or she needs time, with all the dilemma, the writer decided to go with the option of hope i.e, the second option....
after that he uploaded a video which clearly says "I am in LOVE with BALMY" after that the writer is waiting for one full night for her answer but continuously from the night she simply says I don't know(PTA NHI) these words are looking so simple, but these words bring the writer in such a state from where he can't step up or step down because at one side there is great hope and at another side there is nothing....
After that night, a great day of hope came and from the morning 7:00 'o' clock he is waiting for her answer ,after sometime writer texts her and says "Devi" please say something, I am waiting for your answer, and I can't concentrate on my study, so please say either you will like me or not but still Balmy simply says "I don't know' with her answer writer thinks, what the fuck "I don't know" and then he throws his mobile on his bed and gone to his college, but still he is unable to concentrate on his classes...
after the boring classes, when he came back to his room unwillingly he opens his Whatsapp account and checks whether any message will come or not after that he randomly checks the status in his Whatsapp,after seeing the status of BaLMY where a video is there which shows she also loves me and then he came in state of happiness and that point I can't express how much happy I am...the face of writer starts blushing like a reddish dimple on his face, by seeing the dimple his friends asking what happen BRO 'is Anything interesting', with his shy blushing face he says YES...
after that his one friend who knows little about that, with great interest he asks please tell me, BRO what happen...and his friend start guessing 1.she accepts your proposal?????...writer say Yes...by hearing this, he starts saying "Writer Party-party-party"..then with full joy the writer says, of course, my dear, i will...!!!</p>
<p>After the full night talking with messages, the writer started the story "A LIP BALM GIRL" and then above story(the initial few lines of the story) was sent to BALMY...BY reading the story BALMY says  "I love this StorY" and I am in my DREAM WORLD and I can't imagine does really anyone notice me like that...writer says yes my dear...
after that writer came in a funny mood and deliberately he says I know how much time you read the story, and which line you like the most, and now you are in which line... after reading this message she shocked and she is asking "HOW would you KNOW that?????"...
then he says it's my "web app Story" BALMY..So, I know everything....then CLEVERLY she takes the screenshots of the story And cleverly says now I have the screenshots...now tell me how will you know???....then writer says "MY CLEVER BALMY it is A PIRACY"....and both starts laughing through EMOJIS....
</p>
<p>AFTER this texts messaging....THE FIRST time she called him and they are talking in a phone call for half an hour....During this, they are talking about ONE-Another...BUT without specifying their good names.... the writer specify the girl AS BALMY and the GIRL specify  him AS WRITER...and during the conversation she knows but still many times  she asks who is BALMY?? then with a funny mood writer says "someone who is so Special for me", then again she asks please-please specify her name(Btao Naa Plzzz).then writer say it;s you my DEAR then she says REALLY 'I AM YOUR BALMY' then writer says yes-yes-yes and  at last they cut their phone calls...but the writer calls her thrice after cutting the Ist call....it's due to some feelings that wake up in the writer due to phone call...</p>
    <p>Finaly,After the call Balmy  messesged to the Writer "plzz don't tell to anyone that whatever we were talking in a phone call otherwise anyone can pick different meanings with that...so plzzz </p>
    <P>Then,the Writer says "Okkk Dear"</P>
    <p>After the call, they start texting each other and She again says 'I love YOUR StorY' and she says you know about fifty-times I had been read this story...and still I want to read it again and again...then writer says really?? she replied YES and finally she texts I am going to my bed with the story so please don't disturb me....Okkkkk......then writer says Okay BALMY....keep it on.</p>
    
<p> After that the writer and his BAlMY starts talking in a call and they are talking about themselves during the conversation and then they share their secrets, friends, likes, dislikes,about their favorite foods....etc..,</p>
<p>during the conversation, they specify that there are many things are common in between them....And they are building their dreams of future and they are enjoying with their dreams, dreams like if they will marry each other, about the novel and so on..</p>
<p>after that day they are planning for hangouts like they are talking about the trip of COORG(in Banglore), Kerala and so on...

after that day they are texting and talking to each other in the romantic mood they start talking about romance, kisses And.....During this BALMY says I am not going to be physical with you before marriage....ok KKK, But really writer doesn't have any intention like that and he replies 'BALMY my love is really a 'love, not a lust'. so please don't worry about all...
after that, they are talking about themselves and building their trusts....</p>
<h>The Most PAINFUL NiGhT</h>
<p>One day at night when the writer is getting ready for a Birthday party about 11:30 p.m. and along with he is talking with his BALMY through messages and during that she asks the most stupid question "will you still FLirting me????????????????? 
This question hurts the writer a lot and breaks his heart into pieces, and suddenly tears come from his eyes.....
with full sorrow writer says....will you still think that I am flirting with you??? or this Question means you want a breakup??? please tell me, Dear, if you really didn't like me I will never message you in my life and please don't think about me ...I will manage and I am not going to tell or show any messages of you to anyone......and please tell me right now ..if your answer is NO, it doesn't matter but please clear it right now .....
</p>
<p>And then they talk in a call, where the scene is like a Sorrow, the writer doesn't say anything and keeps silent in a call.
after that with weeping sound she said please say something ???then the writer asks with a weeping sound please tell me, will you like me or not???? if not, not a problem but please tell me right now??</p>
<p>then she replied yes I love you and whatever I send to you are my real feeling, and whatever is my status is all for you only...so please don't asks your stupid questions again....and please call me with the name, that you have given to me I love that names...and you know i am feeling awkward when you called me with my good name...so  please always call me with my sweet names of you....and then writer says OK...BALMY</p>
