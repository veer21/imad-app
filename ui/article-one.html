when the first time writer saw that girl then suddenly a feeling of attraction arises towards her,GOD knows whether it is the , feeling of crush or the feeling of love.  but due to lack of communication or due to bussy schedule of the ceremoney ,writer unable to interact with her... then after the ending of the ceremoney both of them are separated from each other towards their DestiNatioN.
</p>
<p>After that AGAIN both of them are meeted in a group.but still writer unable to interact with her. after that a moment came when, may be by mistake,she text him then suddenly a rise of hope arises in him. then till onwards a game of texting message get started and this game consists lots of emojis,certain feelings...Etc, and Finally  he puts his Feeling towards her and the writer thinks that the Lip Balm Girl also Liked him(acc to her Status)........</P>
